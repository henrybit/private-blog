# robots-analyzer
One day, I decided to crawl a website, only to discover its **robots.txt** file. This encounter made me realize the importance of adhering to web scraping ethics and standards. According to the RFC specification ([RFC 9309 - The User-Agent Line](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.html#name-the-user-agent-line)), respecting these rules is essential for responsible web crawling.

To simplify the process and ensure compliance, I decided to develop a **Robots Analyzer**. This tool helps developers easily interpret and follow the rules defined in **robots.txt** files, promoting responsible web scraping practices.  

You can try it out here: [Robots Analyzer - GitHub](#https://spider-web-flax.vercel.app/).
